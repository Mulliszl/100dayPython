# 100 days of python notes

Didn't like jupyter so calling python from Rstudio it is

## day 1 Project

```python
#1. Create a greeting for your program.
print("Welcome to the band name generator 9000!")

#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
city = input("What is the city you grew up in?\n")
#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
pet = input("What is your pet's name?\n")
#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print("Your band name is", city, pet, "\n")
#5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line:

```

### Notes

```python

# Write your code below this line 👇

# Print
print('Hello world')
print('"Hello world" \n "No you"')

# input
input("Insert your prompt for user")

print("Hello world " + input("What is your name?"))

# Variables
# There are two variables, a and b from input
a = input()
b = input()

# 🚨 Don't change the code above ☝️
####################################
# Write your code below this line 👇

c = a
a = b
b = c

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print("a: " + a)
print("b: " + b)

#---------------------------------------------------------
# Day 1 Start 
name = "jack"
print(name)

name = "Angela"
print(name)

name = input("Enter your name")
length = len(name)
print(length)

# end
# input() will get user input in console
# Then print() will print the word "Hello" and the user input
print("Hello " + input("What is your name?"))
```




## Day 2 - Data types & string manipulation
```python
# Day 2 Start
# Data Types
two_digit_number = input()

first_digit = int(two_digit_number[0])
second_digit = int(two_digit_number[1])

# Add the two integers together
two_digit_number = first_digit + second_digit

print(two_digit_number)
```




#### BMI Calculator Mine
```python
# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
height = input()
# 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72
weight = input()
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

# Write your code below this line 👇
bmi = float(weight)/pow(float(height),2)
print(int(bmi))
```




##### BMI Calculator Angela's
```python
height = input()
weight = input()
# Your code below this line 👇
weight_as_int = int(weight)
height_as_float = float(height)
# Using the exponent operator **
bmi = weight_as_int / height_as_float ** 2
# or using multiplication and PEMDAS
bmi = weight_as_int / (height_as_float * height_as_float)

bmi_as_int = int(bmi)
print(bmi_as_int)
```



#### Life in weeks (Fstring) [Mine]
```python
age = input()
56# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆
# Write your code below this line 👇
liveto = 90
weeks = 4000
yearlyweeks = 52

remaining_years = liveto-int(age)
remaing_weeks = remaining_years*52
x = remaing_weeks
print(f"You have {x} weeks left.")

```
##### Life in weeks (Angela) [Mine]
```python
aage = input()
# Your code below this line 👇
years = 90 - int(age)
weeks = years * 52

print(f"You have {weeks} weeks left.")
```


### Day 2 Project: Tip calculator [Mine]
```python
#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 
#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.💪
#Write your code below this line 👇

print("Welcome to the bill split calculator.\n")
bill = float(input("What is the total bill? \n$"))
tip = int(input("What is percent is the the tip? \n"))
split = input("How many people are splitting the bill? \n")
tip_int = tip /100 + 1
total = round(float(bill) * tip_int /int(split), 2)
total = "{:.2f}".format(total)

print(f" Your bill of {bill}, with a tip of {tip}% split between {split} people totals to: \n ${total} per person.")
```


#### Day 2 Project: Tip Calc [Angela]
```python
print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
tip = int(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? "))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill?"))

tip_as_percent = tip / 100
total_tip_amount = bill * tip_as_percent
total_bill = bill + total_tip_amount
bill_per_person = total_bill / people
final_amount = round(bill_per_person, 2)

# FAQ: How to round to 2 decimal places?

# Find the answer in the Q&A here: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn/lecture/17965132#questions/13315048

print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}")
```

## Day 3 conditional and logical operators


```python
if  condition:   
    output
else:
        output
```



### Tasks: odd/even
Modulo == %
performs division and outputs remainder
```python
#Which number do you want to check?
number = int(input())
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

# Write your code below this line 👇
if number % 2 == 0:
  print("This is an even number.")
else: print("This is an odd number.")
```

### tasks: BMI 2.0 Mine

```python
# Enter your height in meters e.g., 1.55
height = float(input())
# Enter your weight in kilograms e.g., 72
weight = int(input())
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇
bmi = weight / height ** 2
bmi = float(bmi)
if bmi < 18.5:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are underweight.")
elif bmi <25:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you have a normal weight.")
elif bmi < 30:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are slightly overweight.")
elif bmi <35:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are obese.")
else:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are clinically obese.")
```


### tasks: Leap year

## Which year do you want to check?
year = int(input())

if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 == 0:
        if year % 400 == 0:
            print("Leap year")
        else:
            print("Not leap year")
    else:
        print("Leap year")
else:
    print("Not leap year")
```

### Tasks: backend pizza bill

```python
print("Thank you for choosing Python Pizza Deliveries!")
size = input()  # What size pizza do you want? "S", "M", or "L"
add_pepperoni = input()  # Do you want pepperoni? "Y" or "N"
extra_cheese = input()  # Do you want extra cheese? "Y" or "N"

# Your code below this line 👇
bill = 0
if size == "S":
    bill += 15
elif size == "M":
    bill += 20
else:
    bill += 25

if add_pepperoni == "Y":
    if size == "S":
        bill += 2
    else:
        bill += 3

if extra_cheese == "Y":
    bill += 1

print(f"Your final bill is: ${bill}.")

```

#### task love calculator
```python
print("The Love Calculator is calculating your score...")
name1 = input()  # What is your name?
name2 = input()  # What is their name?
# Your code below this line 👇
combined_names = name1 + name2
lower_names = combined_names.lower()
t = lower_names.count("t")
r = lower_names.count("r")
u = lower_names.count("u")
e = lower_names.count("e")
first_digit = t + r + u + e

l = lower_names.count("l")
o = lower_names.count("o")
v = lower_names.count("v")
e = lower_names.count("e")
second_digit = l + o + v + e

score = int(str(first_digit) + str(second_digit))
if (score < 10) or (score > 90):
  print(f"Your score is {score}, you go together like coke and mentos.")
elif (score >= 40) and (score <= 50):
  print(f"Your score is {score}, you are alright together.")
else:
  print(f"Your score is {score}.")
```
